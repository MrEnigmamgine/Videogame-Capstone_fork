However a new problem soon emerged. A large increase in earthquakes started to occur, not just on Earth, but on the Moon and Mars as well. As it was soon to be discovered, a rogue black hole had entered into a large decaying orbit with the Sun. The estimates shown that in less than a thousand years, the gravitational tidal forces would become too great for any planet in the solar system to be livable.\\\\n\\\\nTo deal with this harsh reality, the nations of Earth created the New Space Initiative. All telescopes available scanned the skies for new worlds while archives of ones currently known were scanned below.\\\\n\\\\nA planet was found and deemed habitable. It came to be known as Atlas, due to our hopes that one day it would carry the Earth on its shoulders. Also at this time, scientists discovered how to make objects travel at almost the speed of light. However, even with the relativistic effects of near light-speed travel and medical advances in longevity, the planet was still too far away for any human to reach in one lifetime.\\\\n\\\\nSo, for the next 1000 years, Earth sent resources to this new planet in hopes of one day sending humans there. Every corporation on Earth was required to send massive amounts of equipment and weaponry. They were contained in huge freighters on a one way mission. With the frieghters, the sum total of human knowledge was also included on various data disks so nothing would be forgotten. To help prepare the planet for habitation, robots were also sent to seed the land with common trees, grasses, food, and shrubs.\\\\n\\\\nIt was soon determined, via the superlunimal communicators carried by the freighters, that many of the advance supplies which had been sent were disappearing. Details were sparse on what was occuring, but it appeared that they were being taken by creatures that were acting in a seemingly intelligent way; and these were the ones that arrived to begin with, many were lost on the way there due to unknown reasons. Despite this fact, supplies continued to be sent; too much had already been invested to turn back.\\\\n\\\\nIt was the dawn of the new millennium. There was a somber tone in the streets of every city on every corner of the Earth. Everyone was under the shadow of death on top of the quaking earth.

You have been choosen as one of the advance scouts that will prepare the way for the others.\\\\n\\\\nAfter being sent ahead of the massive Lifeships, contact with them was soon lost and to make matters worse, most of the advance scouts were hit by unexpected atmospheric turbulance on the way in, scattering everyone and everything and wrecking most of what you carried.\\\\n\\\\nAfter first planet fall on Atlas, your only goal now is to survive the new planet and ensure humanity\\\\u0027s survival.

The game was released as a largely unfinished product and many parts of it do not work properly at all. \\\\n \\\\nThe packaging of Big Rigs states that the main objective of the game is to race a semi-trailer truck (known colloquially as a \\\\\"big rig\\\\\") in order to safely deliver illegal cargo being carried by the vehicle, while avoiding the local police force. In actuality, there are no police in the game, no such objectives are presented within the game itself and there is no load attached to the truck.[1] Much of the game instead centers on the player racing their truck against fellow drivers to the finish line; however, in the earlier versions the player\\\\u0027s computer-controlled opponent vehicles have no AI and never move from the starting position. In a later version, the computer-controlled opponent will race around the track, but will stop just before crossing the finish line. The timer in the game is merely aesthetic and has no limit on the gameplay. In addition, due to a lack of collision detection, there are no obstacles to navigate within the game, and the player is able to phase through environments and leave the game altogether. \\\\n \\\\nBig Rigs: Over the Road Racing was critically panned. The game\\\\u0027s criticism is largely directed at its \\\\\"blatantly unfinished\\\\\"[2] state: lack of collision detection and frequent violation of the laws of physics, frequent and major software bugs, poor visuals, and severe lack of functionality.

It has since been given multiple parody treatments.\\\\nThe game also achieved Number One \\\\\"Wacky Japanese Game of All Time\\\\\" in the XLEAGUE.TV video game TV show Wez and Larry\\\\u0027s Top Tens and was featured in an episode of the Angry Video Game Nerd.\",\\n    \"tags\": [\\n      1,\\n      268435461,\\n      268435471,\\n      268435472,\\n      536871078,\\n      536871401,\\n      536871837,\\n      536871923,\\n      536872192,\\n      536872407,\\n      536872529,\\n      536872695,\\n      536874083,\\n      536874398,\\n      536874694,\\n      536875259,\\n      536875261,\\n      536875328,\\n      536875526,\\n      536875527,\\n      536875549,\\n      536875562,\\n      536875666,\\n      536876219,\\n      536876393,\\n      536876718,\\n      536877023,\\n      536877551,\\n      536877740,\\n      536897818\\n    ],\\n    \"themes\": [\\n      1\\n    ],\\n    \"total_rating\": 11.1896645078587,\\n    \"total_rating_count\": 14,\\n    \"updated_at\": 1649178970,\\n    \"url\": \"https://www.igdb.com/games/hong-kong-97\",\\n    \"websites\": [\\n      95101,\\n      172984\\n    ],\\n    \"checksum\": \"3639f11c-8e6d-480e-eba7-07f35c3fc324\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"id\": 9077,\\n    \"category\": 0,\\n    \"cover\": 102137,\\n    \"created_at\": 1423958400,\\n    \"external_games\": [\\n      46513,\\n      102497,\\n      1710081\\n    ],\\n    \"first_release_date\": 1104451200,\\n    \"game_modes\": [\\n      1\\n    ],\\n    \"name\": \"Crazy Bus\",\\n    \"platforms\": [\\n      29\\n    ],\\n    \"player_perspectives\": [\\n      4\\n    ],\\n    \"rating\": 11.3566510636749,\\n    \"rating_count\": 5,\\n    \"release_dates\": [\\n      27192\\n    ],\\n    \"slug\": \"crazy-bus\",\\n    \"summary\": \"Crazy Bus (Ônibus louco) is a game about trying to manage the city bus system in Rio de Jareno\",\\n    \"total_rating\": 11.3566510636749,\\n    \"total_rating_count\": 5,\\n    \"updated_at\": 1593475200,\\n    \"url\": \"https://www.igdb.com/games/crazy-bus\",\\n    \"videos\": [\\n      3541\\n    ],\\n    \"checksum\": \"98635e93-6aab-741e-6bcc-a9731ce41dc4\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"id\": 13458,\\n    \"alternative_names\": [\\n      5525,\\n      5526\\n    ],\\n    \"category\": 1,\\n    \"collection\": 194,\\n    \"cover\": 12012,\\n    \"created_at\": 1444686707,\\n    \"first_release_date\": 1348704000,\\n    \"franchises\": [\\n      458\\n    ],\\n    \"game_modes\": [\\n      1,\\n      2\\n    ],\\n    \"genres\": [\\n      16\\n    ],\\n    \"involved_companies\": [\\n      27076\\n    ],\\n    \"keywords\": [\\n      541\\n    ],\\n    \"name\": \"Might \\\\u0026 Magic Heroes VI: Danse Macabre\",\\n    \"parent_game\": 373,\\n    \"platforms\": [\\n      6\\n    ],\\n    \"player_perspectives\": [\\n      3\\n    ],\\n    \"rating\": 11.4082803370108,\\n    \"rating_count\": 5,\\n    \"release_dates\": [\\n      38728\\n    ],\\n    \"screenshots\": [\\n      15110,\\n      15111,\\n      15112,\\n      15113\\n    ],\\n    \"similar_games\": [\\n      7615,\\n      13196,\\n      93694,\\n      99118,\\n      106104,\\n      111187,\\n      112191,\\n      116127,\\n      119156,\\n      119171\\n    ],\\n    \"slug\": \"might-and-magic-heroes-vi-danse-macabre\",\\n    \"summary\": \"Danse Macabre is the second DLC (downloadable content, dubbed adventure packs in this series) for Might \\\\u0026 Magic: Heroes VI.
